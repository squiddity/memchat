# Mem Import

Treat durable artifacts as a **ledger**: normalized source, extraction packets, proposals, canonical transactions, reviews, checks, and the final run record are authoritative. Worker prose is only a receipt.

## 1. Choose the run mode

- **Standalone book:** `mem_import_begin`, then `mem_import_normalize`.
- **Maintained book or series:** read [compendium runs](references/compendium-runs.md), then use its begin and normalize tools.

Inspect the complete manifest. This step is complete when every intended source unit appears in the normalized ledger.

## 2. Prove the worker profile

Use an ordinary subagent facility that enforces a per-child tool allowlist and reports terminal child identity. Assignment results contain the complete child bootstrap and exact `tools` array; pass both verbatim to the child. Request an explicit model and thinking setting from the host.

Before normalizing the requested corpus, tell the user whether exact-profile acceptance is current or whether the acceptance ladder will run first.

For a new or changed installation, or when no deterministic exact-fingerprint acceptance receipt is available, run the [installation acceptance ladder](references/acceptance-ladder.md). A current accepted receipt skips that detailed reference, but never the per-run assignment and dispatch gates.

When the host cannot enforce that profile, call `mem_import_fail` and stop. Read a detected host's adapter reference only when invocation details are needed.

This step is complete when the exact profile has current acceptance evidence and the current run can enforce `assignment.tools`.

## 3. Run the golden path

Read [coordinator decisions](references/workflow.md), then repeat these bounded phases:

1. **Extract:** assign disjoint units, dispatch [extractors](references/extractor-role.md), and inspect persisted packets. Start with one to three workers; widen only after clean evidence.
2. **Propose:** assign accepted extraction shards and dispatch [proposers](references/proposal-role.md). Each proposal accounts for every assigned candidate.
3. **Reconcile when needed:** dispatch [reconcilers](references/reconciler-role.md) for cross-shard or existing-canon identity questions. A fresh shard with no identity question needs no reconciliation wave.
4. **Merge:** dispatch one [merger](references/merger-role.md). It reads immutable proposals and commits bounded batches; the commit tool owns lease and CAS lifecycle.
5. **Review and repair:** dispatch a [reviewer](references/reviewer-role.md). The coordinator selects any actions worth a scoped [repair](references/repairer-role.md).

After each child terminates, record its exact completed dispatch receipt and inspect its durable effect before scheduling dependent work. Retry with a fresh assignment after revocation, not by editing an immutable packet.

## 4. Complete the ledger

Success requires all of the following:

- every intended unit has an accepted extraction packet;
- every used semantic effect has a completed exact-profile ordinary-subagent receipt;
- every extraction candidate has a canonical disposition;
- the canonical revision/hash and transaction history reconstruct successfully;
- no blocking identity conflict remains;
- `mem_check_run` reports no errors;
- `mem_import_finalize` writes a successful schema-v2 `stages/import-run.json`.

A failure is complete only after `mem_import_fail` persists the terminal reason. Never report success from worker prose alone.
